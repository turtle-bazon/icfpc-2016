No packages found in snapshot which provide a "hsc2hs" executable, which is a build-tool dependency of "clipper"
Missing build-tools may be caused by dependencies of the build-tool being overridden by extra-deps.
This should be fixed soon - see this issue https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/595
